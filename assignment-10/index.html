<p>
The day was cold, it was rainy and gloomy.
<br>
But when the rain slowly stopped.
<br>
And, the sun came out from behind the clouds.
<br>
A beautiful rainbow had formed.
<br>
And I looked at the ground because it was a sad reminder.
</p>
<p>
For, the one thing I saw that was so beautiful,
<br>
Had lost its glory.
<br>
I look back up and I think of her.
<br>
The one who fought so tirelessly.
<br>
And was brave til' the end.
</p>
<p>
When, she was well,
<br>
We were free as birds.
<br>
We would walk or ride our bikes,
<br>
And laugh all the while.
<br>
It seemed as though the fun wouldn't stop.
<p>
But, it rained,
<br>
It got dark and it rained hard.
<br>
We seeked shelter at her home
<br>
And waited til' once again we could play.
<br>
Then, the rain stopped.
</p>
<p>
We went outside,
<br>
and looked at the sky,
<br>
And we marveled at God's creation.
<br>
For when we looked,
<br>
We saw the colorful promise.
</p>
<p>
And as we looked, we pondered a thought,
<br>
Why does the rainbow run.
<br>
Theories upon theories, but,
<br>
no acceptable answer.
</p>
<p>
At that moment,
<br>
My auntie looked at me and smiled.
<br>
She said to me, one day,
<br>
We will figure out the secret.
<br>
We will chase rainbows.
</p>
<p>
Another day, came the rain.
<br>
But, the cancer came also.
<br>
And when the rain went away,
<br>
Her sickness stayed.
</p>
<p>
From beside her bed,
<br>
I held her hand.
<br>
She looked at me and said,
<br>
Darling don't be upset,
<br>
We can go chasing another day.
</p>
<p>
Now shes gone,
<br>
and I hang my head.
<br>
I look down and try to hide my face,
<br>
When I see the promise in the sky,
<br>
I think of the promise unfulfilled.
