13. I have come across MANY forms while using the web. The one I run into the most is the Google search bar which acts as a form to "get" information.

14. Text- a text form might be used to gather input from a user.
Selection- Could be used to have a user select a specific option from a list. Button- Could be used to submit a form.

15. Created code that included a table and a couple input forms.
