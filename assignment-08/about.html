    <h1 align="center">Why Winged Eyeliner?<br><img src="./images/blink.gif" alt="Blinking Eye" title="Blinking Eye" width="150" height="125"></h1>
    <p align="left">One question I have always been asked is how do I manage to have perfect winged eyeliner.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have almost always worn winged eyeliner! It was one of my defining styles throughout high school and most of college!
      <br>
      <br>
      It has taken me a lot of time to practice and now I can apply my eyeliner effortlessly without using this method, but it is perfect for someone who needs a little extra help perfecting the technique.
      <br>
      <br>
      Many people have asked me what eyeliner I use and I always reccomend <b>Maybelline Eye Studio Master Precise Eyeliner - 110 Black</b>, as I have used it for years and it has never let me down! I will link it below if you woul like to purchase!
      <br>
      <br>
      Good Luck! And just wing it! ;)
